# 🌟 Anagram Checker 🧩  
Welcome to the **Anagram Checker** repository! Are you ready to dive into the fascinating world of wordplay? This little Python script is here to help you determine whether two strings are **anagrams** of each other. 🌀

## ✨ What is an Anagram?  
An **anagram** is a creative rearrangement of letters from one word or phrase to form another. For example:  
- **listen** → **silent**  
- **dusty** → **study**  
- **conversation** → **voices rant on**  

In this world of letter swaps and magical transformations, this script is your trusted companion! 🎩✨

## 🚀 How It Works  
The **Anagram Checker** script follows these steps:  
1. **Input**: Accepts two strings from the user.  
2. **Preprocessing**: Removes spaces, converts to lowercase, and simplifies comparisons.  
3. **Sorting Magic**: Sorts the characters of both strings alphabetically.  
4. **Comparison**: Checks if the sorted versions of both strings match.  

If they match, **voila!** 🎉 The strings are anagrams! If not, they aren't. 😔

## 🛠️ The Code  

```python
def anagram_checker():
    str1 = input("Enter the first string: ")
    str2 = input("Enter the second string: ")
    if sorted(str1.replace(" ", "").lower()) == sorted(str2.replace(" ", "").lower()):
        return 1  # Yes, they are anagrams
    else:
        return 0  # Nope, not anagrams

print(anagram_checker(), end="")
```

## 🖋️ Usage  

### Step 1️⃣: Run the Script  
Run the script in your favorite Python environment (or terminal).  

### Step 2️⃣: Enter the Strings  
Provide two strings when prompted. Don't worry about spaces or letter case – the script handles them for you!  

### Step 3️⃣: Get Results  
- `1`: The strings are anagrams. 🥳  
- `0`: The strings are not anagrams. 🤔

## 💡 Example  

### Input:  
```
Enter the first string: Hello World  
Enter the second string: dlroW olleH  
```

### Output:  
```
1
```
